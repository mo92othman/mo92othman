# Hi there, I'm Mo 👋

```javascript

I am a passionate developer with an eye for UX/UI. I love working with JavaScript. I enjoy bringing ideas to life from conception to implementation. I try to consider the whole picture, the entire spectrum of a project, from conceptualization to visual aesthetics and user experience. So I enjoy being involved in various aspects of a project, and I'm always eager to learn.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   In 2023, I had a coding journey by joining HackYourFuture, a web development Bootcamp. As an architect with a strong passion for technology and design, I saw the opportunity to merge my existing skills with the dynamic world of web development. Over seven intensive months, I dived into various aspects, starting with JavaScript and progressing to backend development using Node.js. The curriculum included a comprehensive study of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, and at the end, I learned React.

Throughout the Bootcamp, I actively participated in individual and group projects, collaborating with a diverse aspiring developers. Mentors feedback played a crucial role in refining my coding proficiency, fostering problem-solving skills, and shaping my ability to work on digital products. The experience not only deepened my understanding of modern full-stack web applications but also I also learned about Agile principles for effective teamwork. Now I have a good understanding of technologies such as NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, and React, I am excited to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of web development. 🚀
